This virtual machine\ncan be used for network debugging and tuning, intrusion detection, and monitoring the behavior of other\nvirtual machine on the same host and logical network. The only\ntraffic copied is internal to one logical network on one host. There is no\nincrease on traffic on the network external to the host; however a virtual machine\nwith port mirroring enabled uses more host CPU and RAM than other virtual machines.\n\nPort mirroring has the following limitations:\n\n - Hot plugging NIC with a vNIC profile that has port mirroring enabled is not supported.\n - Port mirroring cannot be altered when the vNIC profile is attached to a virtual machine.\n\nGiven the above limitations, it is recommended that you enable port mirroring on an additional,\ndedicated vNIC profile.\n\nIMPORTANT: Enabling port mirroring reduces the privacy of other network users."
